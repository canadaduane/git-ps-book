# Introduction

## What is it?

Git Patch Stack is really three things; a **concept**, a **tool**, and a
**methodology**. The **concept** is the high level mental model used to think
in terms of managing your code changes as a stack of patches rather than a
series of isolated feature branches. The **tool** is a command line interface
to aid in streamlining the process of working within this mental model. And the
**methodology** is the recommended process for defining and making code changes
as well as collaborating with your team around these code changes. These three
things combined are what make Git Patch Stack such a pleasant development
experiences.

## Why use it?

Git Patch Stack provides the following benefits over branch based workflows.

- develop & ship software faster
- don't think about branches anymore
- aligns with best practices for producing more maintainable software
- less mental overhead & complexity
- never blocked by waiting on peer reviews
- smaller, logical code changes, scoped to the application architecture
- more valuable peer reviews
- makes conflict resolution easier
- facilitates continuous integration while still support pre-commit code review

If any of the above benefits call to you then Git Patch Stack is what you want.

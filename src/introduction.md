# Introduction

## What is it?

Git Patch Stack is really three things; a **concept**, a **tool**, and a
**methodology**. The **concept** is the high level mental model used to think
in terms of managing your code changes as a stack of patches rather than a
series of isolated feature branches. The **tool** is a command line interface
to aid in streamlining the process of working within this mental model. And the
**methodology** is the recommended process for defining and making code changes
as well as collaborating with your team around these code changes. These three
things combined are what make Git Patch Stack such a pleasant development
experiences.

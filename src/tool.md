# Tool

The Git Patch Stack command line tool is an extension of Git designed to make
creating & managing your stacks of patches throughout the development and
review lifecycle as easy as possible. It does this by facilitating actions that
make sense within the context of the [conceptual model](./conceptual-model.md)
rather than the concepts & operations of Git and tools like GitHub.
